# Table Processing App

A modern web application for processing tabular data. This application demonstrates front-end development skills with React and Next.js, focusing on data manipulation, calculation, and presentation.

## Features

- **CSV Data Import**: Automatically loads and parses CSV data from a file
- **Interactive Data Display**: Clean, organized presentation of raw CSV data
- **Custom Calculator**: Perform custom calculations between any two data points with four operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- **Automated Calculations**: Pre-configured calculations (Alpha, Beta, Charlie) demonstrate data processing capabilities
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive UI that works on mobile and desktop devices
- **Dark/Light Mode Support**: Adapts to system color scheme preferences

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: React framework for production-grade applications
- **React**: Front-end library for building user interfaces
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript for enhanced developer experience
- **Shadcn UI**: High-quality UI components built on top of Tailwind CSS
- **CSV Parsing**: Custom implementation for processing tabular data

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the application.

## How It Works

1. The application loads a CSV file containing indexed values
2. Raw data is displayed in Table 1
3. Users can perform custom calculations using the interactive calculator
4. Pre-defined calculations are shown in Table 2 with detailed breakdown

## Deployment

The application can be deployed to Vercel or any other hosting service that supports Next.js applications. For production builds, use:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```
